The air around you is cool and crisp, it smells faintly of sage.

The smell is familiar to you for some reason.

You can&#x27;t remember why.

Your body feels heavy, but the ground beneath you is uncomfortable.

Do you open your eyes?

[[Open eyes]]

[[Keep them closed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Open eyes" tags="" position="467.5,497">(set: $Stars to &quot;no stars&quot;)

You pry your eyes open, only to find that there is more darkness beyond your lids. You panic for a moment, thinking you may have gone blind, but in your panic you look up and see the sky.

The stars gaze down upon you, bright and illuminating. They shine like the sky is made of diamonds, beautifully chasing away the darkness. Your eyes adjust to the light and soon the starlight makes everything look almost as bright as day. It&#x27;s a different light though, like everything has been bathed in silver.

You stand up.

[[Carry on]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Keep them closed" tags="" position="991.5,455">You can&#x27;t bring yourself to open your eyes, you allow exhaustion to settle over you and you drift back to sleep.

[[A Star Goes Out-&gt;Sleeping in]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Sleeping in" tags="" position="744.5,478">(set: $Stars to &quot;one star&quot;)

You decided to take those few hours for yourself, no one else was using them as far as you know.

You open your eyes and see a world that is dark but for the light of the stars, a myriad of stars, more than could ever be counted.

One of those stars has blinked out of existence.

As you get to your feet you feel a weight in your pocket, you look inside and see $Stars.

You also have the hours you took for sleeping. They are somehow tangible, you can carry them like an object.

[[Carry on]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Carry on" tags="" position="574.5,727">You look around at the starlit world and take a breath, the scent of sage filling your nostrils. You are standing in the center of an empty street. Along the street there are a handful of buildings and a single small car.
You can see a pawn shop, a coffee shop called &lt;em&gt; Baxter&#x27;s &lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt; Underwood Dress Boutique &lt;/em&gt;.
What do you do?

You see the driver-side window is rolled down all the way. You look inside and see a bag sitting in the passenger seat. It seems to be filled with miscelleneous items of some value, the driver probably took them here to be pawned.

Do you reach into the car and take the bag?

[[Take bag]]

[[Leave bag]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Examine pawn shop" tags="" position="461.5,873">It&#x27;s not a very nice pawn shop, but the door is unlocked. The bell jingles as you walk inside. You are greeted by the smell that all objects accrue when they grow old and it erases the comforting smell of sage. You&#x27;re the only one here and the silence makes you hesitate.
You see a handgun on the counter with some ammunition beside it.

Do you take the gun?

[[Take gun]]

[[Leave gun]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Examine Baxter&#x27;s" tags="" position="649.5,877">You enter the coffee shop, the faint smell of roasted coffee beans mixes with the smell of sage as you walk in. The place looks like it would be quaint in the right lighting, but with only the stars is looks ghostly.

Out of instinct you sit at a table as though you&#x27;re waiting for your order of black coffee with a dash of suger to be served.

It will never come, you are alone.

On the table in front of you there rests a wallet that you did not notice before. You open it and see the driver&#x27;s license for a middle-aged woman, she is an organ donor. The wallet contains around forty-five dollars cash, some cards, a worn theatre ticket to &lt;em&gt;Jekyll and Hyde the Musical&lt;/em&gt;, and a picture of a baby.

Do you take the wallet?

[[Take wallet]]

[[Leave wallet]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Examine Underwood Dress Boutique" tags="" position="799.5,877">You walk into the colorful dress shop, the gowns are largely gaudy and bright. Walking through the shop is like walking through a flower garden if every flower was drowning in frills and fake gemstones. There is no scent of flowers either, only a plastic scent that stings your eyes, it does not pair well with the smell of sage.

You find yourself chuckling at some of the frankly dizzying patterns, the countless scratchy sequins don&#x27;t hold a candle to the stars outside.

Something crunches under your foot, you look down to see an envelope.

You pick it up and examine it, it&#x27;s pink and the back only says &lt;em&gt;To My One True Love&lt;/em&gt; in loopy cursive.

You snort at the extravagence of what is clearly a love letter, it fits well with the dress shop you are in.

Do you take the letter?

You fall back, a gaping hole in your middle. The voices recede into the darkness with your heart and items, laughing.

You are amazed that you do not die.

As you lay there, empty in your body and your soul, your eyes turn to the sky and see that there is only one star left.

You took all but one star, the world is dim in it&#x27;s singular light, but it remains and you remain with it.

But without your heart, it means nothing to you.

You suddenly feel as though your arms and legs are being grasped by some invisible force while the rest of your body is held still. You scream as the pressure and pain increase, you beg for it to stop, but it does not.

Your limbs tear from your body, you are drawn and quartered, leaving you as nothing but a torso.

You have never known a pain so great. Your mind cannot accept the absence of these limbs, but they are not there.

Yet you do not die.

The voices recede into the darkness, cackling, taking your arms, legs, and items with them.

You can only weep and lie there helplessly, staring at the sky. Through your tears you can see a handful of stars where there used to be many.

The sky is still lit, though it is not bright. You can still smell the sage, though you can also smell your own blood. You remain, a fraction of yourself, the stars and sage remain, also a fraction of themselves.

Nothing is whole and nothing will be again.

Your ribs are parted with agonizing slowness and your lungs fly from your body as though they were never attached to you.

Your mouth hangs open soundlessly. It is more pain than you think you can bear as you fall to the ground, limbless and breathless.

Yet you do not die.

The voices recede into the darkness, laughing hysterically, taking with them your arms, legs, lungs, and items.

You lie there, unable to move without your limbs, unable to find comfort in the scent of sage without your lungs.

You mouth at the air like a fish, too in shock to do much more.

The stars hang above you like a diarama, though they are less numerous and brilliant than before. You took some for yourself and left the sky with less.

Now you both have less than when you began, but the sky is at least nice to look at now that you cannot do much else.

You scream as you realize that this force is seeking to sever your head from your body. You claw at your own neck, stumbling about in horror and desperation, looking for an escape.

You do not find it.

In a swift motion accompanied by a wet sound your head seperates from your shoulders, your screams stop, your stumbling stops, your clawing stops, it all stops except for the fearful darting of your eyes and the gaping of your mouth.

You watch helplessly as your body is dragged away into the darkness along with the one item and the voices that laugh mercilessly at you.

You are nothing but a head, but you are turned up toward the sky, you can see the gorgeous stars, almost completely whole but for the small piece you took. There is as much of you left as you took from the sky, you are even now.

The stunning stars calm you somewhat. You can aslo still smell the sage, and it comforts you just a tiny bit. At least you have majority of the beauty of this world left to keep you company.

True to their word you feel your entire body light up with pain, like every one of your cells is being torn in a different direction.

You scream, but you are only able to do so for a moment as your mind is wrenched from your body, you can now gaze upon everything you were. Your body is limp and cold without you in it, and from where you are it seems like an abstract concept that it was once you.

Now you are nothing but what you think might be a soul, you cannot feel the air, you cannot move the world around you, you cannot exist in the way you did.

The voices recede into the darkness with your body and enraged howls.

However, you do not die.

You can still see, though without eyes it is as though the visible world is part of you, the scent of sage is part of you too and it makes you feel peaceful. You look upward and see the sky, perfect, untouched, absolutely mesmerizing. You feel the starlight become part of you, and you too become beautiful and begin to emit a soft light.

Somehow, you sense yourself move and you are among the stars alongside the billions of people that came before you, all of you, together, make the starlight.


You are a star, you have lost all you were, but the sage and the starlight remain and you remain as a part of them.

You are content.

You jump to your feet with a surge of energy you didn&#x27;t know you had, but you quickly become $Health. You try to take a step but you can&#x27;t stay on your feet. You fall.

Do you put your hands out to break your fall?

You carefully get to your feet, even though your body protests. You feel a little $Health but you stay standing.
You look around. You&#x27;re in the middle of a street called &lt;em&gt; Harmony &lt;/em&gt;, there is one car on it, the car is in pretty good shape. There are buildings on either side of the street.
There is a coffee shop called &lt;em&gt; Baxter&#x27;s &lt;/em&gt;, a hair salon called &lt;em&gt; Smart Snippers &lt;/em&gt;, a furniture store called &lt;em&gt; Harpoon Coast &lt;/em&gt;, and a designer dress shop called &lt;em&gt; Underwood Boutique &lt;/em&gt;.

You groan from the pain and turn your head, something on the ground catches your eye. You look closer and see that is is a necklace.
It&#x27;s small with a silver chain, the pendant is a silver butterfly wing with a shimmering blue stone in it, but it&#x27;s only one wing, like it is half of a whole. 

Do you take the necklace?
